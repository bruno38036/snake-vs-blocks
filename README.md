# SCC0504 — Substitute Project: Snake vs. Blocks

**Technology:** Java Swing desktop application  
**Main class:** `Main`

This project implements a single-player arcade game inspired by *Snake vs. Blocks* using Java Swing. It was designed to cover the required SCC0504 learning outcomes: game loop design, object-oriented entity hierarchy, collision detection, score management, game states, and local persistence.

## Features implemented

- Swing `JFrame` with a custom-painted `GamePanel`.
- Main menu with **New Game**, **High Scores**, and **Exit**.
- Automatic upward snake movement with left/right arrow steering.
- Falling numbered blocks with random values from 1 to 20.
- Collision between snake head and blocks decreases the block value by 1.
- Destroyed blocks award points equal to their original value.
- Blocks reaching the bottom remove one snake segment.
- Food items fall between blocks and increase snake length when eaten.
- Score and snake length displayed on screen.
- Difficulty increases every 200 points.
- Game Over screen with final score, restart and exit options.
- Top 5 high scores saved to a local file.
- OOP entity hierarchy with `FallingObject` as an abstract superclass, extended by `Block` and `FoodItem`.

## How to compile and run

From the project root:

```bash
javac -d out src/*.java
java Main
```

## Controls

- **Left Arrow:** move snake left
- **Right Arrow:** move snake right
- **P:** pause/resume
- **ESC:** return to main menu

## Notes

The game saves high scores in the local file `snake_vs_blocks_highscores.txt`, created in the same directory where the program is executed.
